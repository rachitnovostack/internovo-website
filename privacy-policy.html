                    <h3 class="mt-4">Public Forums</h3>
                    <p class="mt-3">IVPL sites may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums, which may
                        require creation of
                        an account with a third party. Any information You provide in these areas may be visible to the
                        public, so we recommend that You avoid disclosing personal information. To request removal of
                        Your personal information from these areas, contact us at compliance@internovo.in. In some
                        cases, we may not be able to remove Your personal information, in which case we will let you
                        know if we are unable to do so and why</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Billing Cycle</h3>
                    <p class="mt-3">IVPL services subscription fee alongwith any other charges You may incur in
                        connection with Your use of the platform, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be
                        charged to your Method of Payment on the due date as per Your subscription. The length of Your
                        billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that You choose when You signed up for the
                        service. In some cases Your payment date may change, for example if Your Method of Payment has
                        not successfully settled, when You change Your subscription plan or if Your paid membership
                        began on a day not contained in a given month. We may authorize your Method of Payment in
                        anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including
                        authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as You register. If You
                        signed up for IVPL services using Your account with a third party as a Method of Payment, You
                        can find the billing information about Your IVPL services subscription by visiting Your account
                        with the applicable third party.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Method of Payment</h3>
                    <p class="mt-3">To use the IVPL services You must provide one or more Method(s) of Payment. You
                        authorize us to charge any Method of Payment associated to Your account in case your primary
                        Method of Payment is declined or no longer available to us for payment of Your subscription fee.
                        You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled,
                        due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and You do not cancel Your account, we may
                        suspend Your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Method of Payment.
                        For some Methods of Payment, the issuer may charge You certain fees, such as transaction fees or
                        other fees relating to the processing of Your Method of Payment. Local tax charges may vary
                        depending on the Method of Payment used. Check with Your Method of Payment service provider for
                        details.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">For Your convenience, Your subscriptions may auto-renew until You cancel the
                        service.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Updating your Method of Payment</h3>
                    <p class="mt-3">You can update your Method of Payment by going to the "Subscription" page. We may
                        also update Your Method of Payment using information provided by the payment service providers.

                        Payment.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Cancellation of Subscription</h3>
                    <p class="mt-3">You can cancel Your IVPL services’ subscription at any time, and You will continue
                        to have access to the IVPL services through the end of Your billing period. To the extent
                        permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or

                        subscription, Your account will automatically close at the end of Your current billing period.
                        If You signed up for IVPL services using Your account with a third party as a Method of Payment
                        and wish to cancel Your subscription, You may need to do so through such third party, for
                        example by visiting Your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or
                        unsubscribing from the IVPL services through that third party.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">On expiry of the free trial period, You will not be able to access Your IVPL
                        services’ account &/or services until You subscribe for a paid subscription plan.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Changes to the Subscription Plans and/or Pricing</h3>
                    <p class="mt-3">We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time;
                        however, any price changes or changes to Your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30
                        days following notice to You.</p>
